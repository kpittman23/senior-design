Our project, _Music Machines: An Hour of Code Activity_, is about using music to help kids learn about computer science and coding. Hour of Code is a non-profit global computer science education movement that aims to engage students of all ages and backgrounds and teach them about coding in fun ways. Our project will follow the Hour of Code guidelines, and thus our project will be free and self-guided. It will benefit society by allowing kids of all ages, genders, and backgrounds to learn about computer science. 

This project helps us promote diversity by making computer science accessible for all groups. All members of our group are very passionate about getting people involved in computer science, specifically girls. This project is designed to avoid stereotypes that might deter different groups from participating. The only diversity/cultural constraints we face are related to the age group we are targeting. Because we are gearing our app towards elementary aged children, we must consider the reading level, motor skills, and world experience that children have. 

Our project does face some ethical/security concerns. Our app will be primarily used by children and schools. We will have to be careful if/when we have any of their personal information. We would only need personal information in the event that we are allowing users to create accounts. We have also been thinking about how users will be able to share their creations, so we have to consider the information we will require for sharing. 

Finally, we face some financial limitations. We are responsible for hosting and maintaining our application. This means that depending on the amount of users and traffic we see, we could be forced to upgrade from AWS free tier. We are also responsible for purchasing our own domain.
