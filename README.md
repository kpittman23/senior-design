## Music Machines
### Project Abstract
Computer science education, especially for young children, is important because it teaches valuable life skills and engages everyone, no matter their background, preventing stereotypes from forming.

The Hour of Code is a global computer science education movement that Code.org started in 2013. Since then, it has engaged over 100 million students around the world in 45 different languages. During Hour of Code activities, females make up 50% of all participants.

Our project will engage students in computer science through music. It will allow them to express themselves creatively by creating new songs with conditionals, loops, and more basic computer science concepts.

### Design Diagrams
[Design Diagram 0](https://github.com/kpittman23/senior-design/blob/master/Assignment%204/D0.pdf):
Design Diagram one is our most basic diagram. It shows the relationship between the student, the webapp, and the speakers. The student interacts with the webapp to create their music, and in turn, the webapp will create a sound that will play from the speakers. 

[Design Diagram 1](https://github.com/kpittman23/senior-design/blob/master/Assignment%204/D1.pdf):
Design diagram 2 is an expansion of design diagram 1. It shows the same interaction between the student, the webapp, and the speaker, but it also adds some interactions between the webapp and third party libraries. The webapp will interact with blockly to build the drag and drop code blocks. It will also interact with react.js as the building blocks for the app. The webapp will also interact with a server, but we have not yet determined what type of server we will use. 

[Design Diagram 2](https://github.com/kpittman23/senior-design/blob/master/Assignment%204/D2.pdf):
Design diagram 3 is an expansion of design diagram 2. It shows the same interaction between the student, the webapp, and the speaker, as well as the third party libraries we plan to use. Design diagram 3 also shows static content, including the images and sound clips we are going to collect for out webapp.

### Appendix
References, citations, links to code repos we will be using, meeting notes, evidence of 45 hours of effort per team member (we met 3-6 every week of the semester during senior design time or made up for it with individual research on our own outside class every week)
