## Music Machines
### Project Abstract
Computer science education, especially for young children, is important because it teaches valuable life skills and engages everyone, no matter their background, preventing stereotypes from forming.

The Hour of Code is a global computer science education movement that Code.org started in 2013. Since then, it has engaged over 100 million students around the world in 45 different languages. During Hour of Code activities, females make up 50% of all participants.

Our project will engage students in computer science through music. It will allow them to express themselves creatively by creating new songs with conditionals, loops, and more basic computer science concepts.

### Design Diagrams
[Design Diagram 0](https://github.com/kpittman23/senior-design/blob/master/Assignments/Fall%204%20Design%20Diagrams/D0.pdf):
Design Diagram one is our most basic diagram. It shows the relationship between the student, the webapp, and the speakers. The student interacts with the webapp to create their music, and in turn, the webapp will create a sound that will play from the speakers. 

[Design Diagram 1](https://github.com/kpittman23/senior-design/blob/master/Assignments/Fall%204%20Design%20Diagrams/D1.pdf):
Design diagram 2 is an expansion of design diagram 1. It shows the same interaction between the student, the webapp, and the speaker, but it also adds some interactions between the webapp and third party libraries. The webapp will interact with blockly to build the drag and drop code blocks. It will also interact with react.js as the building blocks for the app. The webapp will also interact with a server, but we have not yet determined what type of server we will use. 

[Design Diagram 2](https://github.com/kpittman23/senior-design/blob/master/Assignments/Fall%204%20Design%20Diagrams/D2.pdf):
Design diagram 3 is an expansion of design diagram 2. It shows the same interaction between the student, the webapp, and the speaker, as well as the third party libraries we plan to use. Design diagram 3 also shows static content, including the images and sound clips we are going to collect for out webapp. 

### Project Tasks and Timeline, Effort Matrix
This section looks a little bit different for us than most teams as we decided we're going to plan our project using Agile methodologies. We will be planning our work on a per-sprint basis as we have so many unknowns and we all feel like we can pick up whatever work needs to be completed. This will allow us to be flexible and adapt to any new issues that may arise as we start work on the project.

We will be using Trello to keep track of each of our stories, or tasks. We've created a shared team space within Trello and created a board for each of the different epics we think we'll need (deciding on and standing up the framework, back end work, front end work, and hosting/deploying the application). We also have included a backlog board with some stretch goals that we will work on if we complete everything else in time. We will break up each epic into individual stories with points assigned to them as we are ready to work the epic, and we will each pull in stories as we have time. We will update an effort matrix with these as we complete the work, but we plan on splitting all of the work pretty equally.

We did break out the first framework epic into the individual tasks listed below:

* Create React Web App - 1 point
* Create Wireframe for Home (Introduction) page - 3 points
* Finalize a curriculum for the project - 5 points
* Create Wireframe for Activity Pages - 5 points
* Create Wireframe for Conclusion page - 3 points
* Review, edit and finalize wireframe drafts - 3 points
* Research and decide on Audio API - 5 points
   - Where are we grabbing the sounds from?
   - How are we combining the sounds?
   - How are we saving & exporting the data?
* Research Servers/Hosting - 8 points
   - Where are we hosting?
   - How much will it cost?
   - What tier is sufficient?
   - How to integrate with node?
   - How to send email?
   - How to save a music file?
* Create Audio Service - 3 points
   - Just standing up the basic service and hitting the Audio API/getting a response
* Research Blockly Integration - 3 points
   - How do we customize the blocks?
   - How do we convert this to "real" code that we can use?

Our trello boards are private to our team, but I've included the link [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rsQWjBcVgQcL_Pdpi6iWaus7aCcYcQ7YxgF-0GnhhTY/edit) for the team and Dr. Annexstein to view.
