	1. Can you make blob 1 play some music? What do you think will happen?
		a. All blob play blocks but they have to use at least one blob 1 block to move on. Repeat block in there just for fun
	2. All the blobs want to play music! Can you make all 3 play music?
		a. All blob play blocks, repeat block in there just for fun
	3. Blob 2 LOVES to play A. It won't be happy until it plays A 6 times in a row. Help!
		a. Only blob 2 block in there and repeat block in there. To pass, blob 2 needs to play A 8 times in a row (whether its with repeat or not)
	4. Can you make Blob 2 play A 6 times with only one play note block?
		a. Only blob 3. Now they have to use repeat
	5. Can you make sure that Blob 3 gets a chance to play C?
		a. Repeat 4 times Blob 1 play C prefilled, repeat 4 times Blob 2 play C prefilled, repeat 4 times empty- they need to fill in Blob 3 play C
	6. Do you see a pattern? Can you play the same thing with only 4 blocks?
		a. Blob 1 play C, Blob 2 play D, Blob 2 play E x3- they need to put the repeated part in one repeat loop
	7. What's this new block? Can you make Blob 1 play D and E at the same time?
		a. Pre-filled loop repeat 3 times Blob 1 play D, then repeat 3 times Blob 1 play E. Need to drag over and 'and' block and put Blob 1 play D in one side, blob 1 play E in the other
	8. Find the pattern and repeat it!
		a. Prefilled: Blob 1 play C and blob 1 play E, Blob 2 play C and blob 2 play E, blob 3 play C and blob 3 play C in there 3 times each- put the first three in a repeat 3 times block
	9. Can you make Blob 2 play all 5 notes at once?
